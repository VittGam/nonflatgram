*A flat paper plane simply does not fly.*

This is an experimental project for a Telegram client for Android, that incorporates all the features and bug fixes of the Official Telegram Client for Android by DrKLO, but that does not follow the (IMHO quite ugly) Google Material Design.

### About Telegram

[Telegram](https://www.telegram.org/) is a messaging platform focused on speed and security. It's super fast, simple and free.

For more info, please refer to the [official App repository](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram).
